### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a graduate student in [DATA INFORMATICS OF SYSTEMS IMPROVEMENT AND DESIGN (DISIDE) LABORATORY](https://www.ise.ufl.edu/diside/) at [Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://www.ise.ufl.edu/), [University of Flolrida](https://www.ufl.edu/). I am particularly interested in how we can build a robust machine learning algorithm system that can __solve real-world problems.__ Prior to UF, I received B.S. degree in Management Information Systems(MIS) from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.
